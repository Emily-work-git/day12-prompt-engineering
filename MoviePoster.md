In the foreground, a mysterious figure in a sleek, high-tech suit stands on a rooftop, gazing at a massive digital billboard displaying cryptic messages. The title 'Eclipse Protocol' is boldly featured at the top in metallic font. The atmosphere is tense and atmospheric, with a hint of cyberpunk aesthetics."

2. Fantasy Adventure
Prompt: "A lush, enchanted forest filled with towering ancient trees and glowing magical creatures. In the center, a brave young hero holding a glowing sword stands confidently, flanked by a wise old wizard and a fierce warrior with a bow. The title 'Legends of Arcania' spirals around them in ornate, mystical lettering. The scene is vibrant, full of color, and evokes a sense of wonder and adventure."

3. Horror Mystery
Prompt: "A foggy, abandoned Victorian mansion on a hill, surrounded by twisted trees and overgrown vines. The moon casts an eerie glow over the scene, revealing a shadowy figure standing at the mansion's entrance. The title 'Whispers in the Dark' is written in chilling, jagged letters at the bottom. The mood is suspenseful and haunting, with a sense of impending doom."
