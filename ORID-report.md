### ORID Report - Emily

#### Objective: What Did We Learn Today?
We have learnt a few important topics and tools to help clarify product goal today, including elevator pitch, user persona, user journey, and genAI and prompt engineering.

#### Reflective: My Feelings
I find today's content useful to create a more user-centered product and improve my content generation strategies.

#### Interpretive: Why?
While working on in-class exercise, I gained a solid understanding of how to design user journeys and personas, I think they are some really good tools to understand our user's painpoint better and facilitate us to create a more user-centered product. I also found the use of an elevator pitch particularly useful in conveying the essence of a product or idea concisely.
